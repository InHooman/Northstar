   ***For Origin users:***
   In Origin, click on *Origin* in top left, then *Application settings*. 
   After that, go to *installs and saves*. 
   In there, you will find a default path to the install folder.
   Unless you changed it before, it's C:\Program Files (x86)\Origin Games
   If you changed the default directory, or specified a different directory when installing the game, you will need to head there.
